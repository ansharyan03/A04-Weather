This is a one-page application that uses Next.js and TailwindCSS. You can search for any location in the given example formats and retrieve its weather data on screen. On the bottom of the screen there is a button that reveals a joke at random. The joke pool changes every hour.

The APIs I used were OpenWeatherMap's One Call 3.0 and Geocoding API to get the latitude and longitude data for a location, which then gives you the weather.

I also used JokeAPI, a free API-keyless REST API that gives you jokes based on given parameters, to display jokes.
